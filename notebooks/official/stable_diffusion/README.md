[Training, tuning and deploying a PyTorch stable diffusion model on Vertex AI](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/stable_diffusion/dreambooth_stablediffusion.ipynb)

```
Learn to build, train, tune and deploy a stable diffusion 2.0 model using HuggingFace and PyTorch on
[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex/).

The steps performed include:

- Fine tune the stable diffusion 2.0 model with your own images.
- Upload the model artifacts to Google Cloud Storage.
- Check the created model artifacts.
- Upload the model in the PyTorch prebuilt container.
- Create an endpoint on Vertex AI.
- Deploy the model to the endpoint.
- Generate a new image.

```
